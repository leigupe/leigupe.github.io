## Penn Power Electronics Research Lab (PENGUIN Lab)
Welcome! We are a research group passionate about building circuits — especially in the field of [power electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_electronics). Our focus is on creating efficient, compact systems that power exciting technologies, including renewable energy platforms, AI hardware, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machines, semiconductor processing tools, robotics, and electric vehicles. [Here](https://leigupe.github.io/research/) are some highlights from our past work. 
<!-- I lead the Penn Power Electronics Research Lab. My lab focuses on technology innovations centered around wide bandgap devices, high-frequency magnetic components, circuits and architectures, and others to improve the efficiency and shrink the requisite size of power conversion for a wide range of essential applications. -->

Our research is deeply interdisciplinary, drawing from circuits, electromagnetics, optics, piezoelectricity, semiconductor devices, and control theory. If any of this sparks your interest, feel free to reach out! Here are a few of the areas we’re currently exploring:
- Innovative power delivery: Inductive power transfer, integrated optical power delivery and sensing;  
- Miniaturized energy conversion: High-frequency circuits, wide-bandgap semiconductors, integrated power management, piezoelectric passives;  
- Powering medical technologies: MRI, ultrasound, X-rays, and implantable devices.

## About Me
I am an Assistant Professor in the [Electrical and Systems Engineering Department](https://www.ese.upenn.edu) at the University of Pennsylvania. I am broadly interested in power electronics, energy conversion, and medical devices. I am also a visiting researcher in the circuits group at [NVIDIA Research](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/), working on data center power delivery. Before NVIDIA, I worked at Apple. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford in 2019.

<!-- I will be taking new graduate students in the foreseeable future. If you are interested in working with me at Penn, please apply to [Penn Engineering’s graduate program](https://gradadm.seas.upenn.edu), and mention my name in your application. Please be mindful that I receive a large number of emails from prospective students asking me to evaluate their resumes and inquiring about research assistantships in my group. Please do not be discouraged if I do not respond or respond only with a short email due to limited bandwidth. I tend to take on 1-2 new students each year, and so I need to be selective and defer the evaluations and decisions until I see the entire pool of applicants in January. For master students, I recommend you take my course ESE5800 or ESE6710 first.  -->

I expect to take on new graduate students in the near future. If you're interested in working with me at Penn, please apply to the [Penn Engineering graduate program](https://gradadm.seas.upenn.edu) and mention my name in your application. While I appreciate the interest, I receive many emails from prospective students and may not be able to respond to each one in detail. I usually take 1–2 new students per year and make decisions after reviewing the full pool of applicants in January. For master’s students, I recommend starting by taking my course ESE5800 or ESE6710.
